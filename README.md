#Changes made:

* Add classes to html because styling raw elements is dangerous. What if we will add new markup, or change existing one - like what if we decide to use h1 instead of h2 for the article title? That's the only chagnes to markup;

* Include normalize.css. Basically, for such a simple project we don't need it, but assuming we would work on it, I'd like to add it;

* A bit of styling;

* Add meta viewport;

* Add a simple media query for screen sizes >= 960px;

* Add collapsible behaviour. I use zepto.js for class change + simple css transitions.

* Add .htaccess from http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/.
